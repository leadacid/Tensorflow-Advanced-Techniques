# Tensorflow-Advanced-Techniques
About TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML, and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow is commonly used for machine learning applications such as voice recognition and detection, Google Translate, image recognition, and natural language processing.
